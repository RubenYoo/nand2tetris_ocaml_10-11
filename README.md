To run the Jack compiler and generate .vm files, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Jack Compiler**: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed and the Jack compiler source code available. If you haven't already, clone or download the Jack compiler source code from the provided link.

2. **Build the Compiler**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the Jack compiler source code. Use the appropriate build command based on the build system used by the compiler. In this case, the example command uses `dune` as the build system:
   ```
   dune build jack_compiler.exe
   ```

3. **Run the Compiler**: Once the build process is complete, you can run the Jack compiler using the following command:
   ```
   dune exec ./jack_compiler.exe <path_to_directory_without_last_Slash>
   ```
   Replace `<path_to_directory_without_last_Slash>` with the path to the directory containing the .jack files you want to compile. Make sure to omit the trailing slash at the end of the path.

4. **Check the Output**: After running the compiler, it will generate .vm files in the same directory where the .jack files are located. Each .jack file will have a corresponding .vm file generated by the compiler.

Make sure to follow any additional instructions or guidelines provided by the original project documentation to ensure a successful compilation process.
